# REFACTORING
* find a better way to reorganise the classes key-pair values in reload()

# TEST CASES
* id is a string
* timestamp values of updated_at and created_at are string in to_dict method BUT
* are datetime objs inside the Basemodel (we can also test for the exact string format of these datetime)
